# GradientDescent_LogisticRegression_WDBCDataset

The above code performs:

Logistic Regression on WDBC dataset. However the optimization technique used for LR was coded from scratch, so was the entire process of LR. The technique used here were Gradient Descent and its variants (Stochastic, Nesterov, Heavy Ball, etc.) their convergence compared, and the coding output compared for these techniques in terms of classification error results.

This coding from scratch was an important portion of learning how optimization techniques are actually implemented and how they can be used practically in varied real life applications.

This was done as part of course EE546, Mathematics of High Dimensional Data, under Prof. Mahdi Soltanolkotabi, in Fall 2020.

The commit was done in Spring 2021 as a public record in a public repository
